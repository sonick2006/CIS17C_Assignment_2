Assignment_2 CIS_17C - Nicholas Abdulkarim

In this assignment, I created a template based container that stores elements dynamically, resizes when capacity is reached. It tracks both size and capacity, supports element access with bounds checking through the at() method, and allows adding or removing elements using push_back() and pop_back(). it contains iterator support making ranged based loops possible. Overallm it functions as a simplified vector with basic exception handeling.
